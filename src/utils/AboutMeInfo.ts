It is an incredible software consultancy; where I met so many wonderful people and learned from them more than I could imagine.<br/><br/>Also; during my co-op; when everything was remote; my friends and I launched a Google Developer Student Club at the Conestoga; which was an incredible experience. We hosted different events and were reaching out to as many students as we could to to build a community of individuals interested in technologies.'

Building a React management tool for it; creating services in TypeScript and JavaScript; operating with MongoDB NoSQL database as well as with PostgreSQL relational database. It also involved working with Google Cloud Platform.<br/><br/>* Agile Development workflow'

    text: '* Test Driven Development – the technique I worked a lot with on the projects at Vehikl.<br/><br/>* Mob programming (check out my article about it on the Writing page!); pairing (working effectively in a group).<br/><br/>* Exploring and working with Laravel; Java.<br/><br/>* Switching between the projects - efficient context switching: jumping from one project to another in the software consultancy helps learning to work in different settings.'
